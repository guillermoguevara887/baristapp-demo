BaristaApp – Demo Version
A lightweight, front-end only prototype showcasing core flows for a smart restaurant management system.
🚀 Overview
BaristaApp Demo is a simplified front-end prototype designed to visually demonstrate the core flows and value proposition of a future full restaurant management platform.
This demo focuses on presentation, user experience, business logic simulation, and AI-enhanced insights — without requiring authentication, backend servers, or databases.
The goal is to provide a clear preview of the vision behind BaristaApp:
a modular, intelligent, easy-to-use management app for small restaurants, cafés, pupuserías, and food vendors.
